You will need nodejs installed.

Then do:

npm start

That should download the nodejs module deps and start a nodejs server
to serve the static content.

For now, when you change a javascript file or add new ones under the
modules directory, stop the running app.  Then start it back up with
npm start.  This will make gulp regenerate the app.js from all of the
javascript under the modules dir.

If you need to add additional nodejs modules, add them to package.json.
Then do a <script> include in the top level index.html to load the module
from the node_modules directory.  Then you can go about using it like
normal.
